This is (a beginning attempt at) sandboxing in python.

The goal of this package is to facilitate creating a sandbox within a python program to allow for safe use of unknown code.  This has no completion in sight, so please manually review all code you use in here.  This may be enough to catch the attempts that look like normal code.

This project is very, very far away from being a true sandbox.  In the meantime, its use will be to create and modify semi-isolated Python environments.

Obviously, this project is very difficult, and it's definite that I will not be able to create a perfect sandbox.  Therefore, if you want to try to break it, please do!  
There are three levels of challenge files I have prepared.  Easy, which allows for use of any module, medium, which allows for use of any built-in module, and hard, which does not allow for any imports.  If you can break it, please send me the solution file so I can fix the issue!

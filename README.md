This is sandboxing in python.

The goal of this package is to facilitate creating a sandbox within a python program to allow for safe use of unknown code.  This is currently unfinished, use at your own risk.

Obviously, this project is very difficult, and it's definite that I will not be able to create a perfect sandbox.  Therefore, if you want to try to break it, please do!  
There are three levels of challenge files I have prepared.  Easy, which allows for use of any module, medium, which allows for use of any built-in module, and hard, which does not allow for any imports.  If you can break it, please send me the solution file so I can fix the issue!
